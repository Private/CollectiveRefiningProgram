Collective Refining Program
=========================

Software supporting a corporation-based refining program, making isk and freeing up time for everyone involved.


The Collective Refining Program is a piece of utility software for EVE Online. It manages EVE API keys, the EVE Online database dump, and the aggregated market data of 3rd party sites to build an overview of hangar contents. This software assists in the valuation of items, and automates the comparison of refining yields and market data. 

Other software does a similar job - this software is made available on a basis of openness. Our members should have the software used to run the CRP, so they know exactly what to expect.
